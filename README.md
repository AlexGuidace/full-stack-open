# Full Stack open MOOC

The focus of this Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is practical, hands-on, full-stack web development learning and building, using the JavaScript ecosystem.

A brief description of the course from the [course site](https://fullstackopen.com/):

> Get your hands on React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript! The course introduces modern web application development using JavaScript. The main focus is on single page applications implemented using the React library, and the REST interfaces implemented with Node.js that support them.

Please see the "part" directories in this repository for my work in this course, and READMEs concerning that work. 🧑🏻‍💻
