# Anecdotes App

This app is built with React + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It allows a user to get a random quote (anecdote) about software development on their screen, and vote on quotes they like best. The highest-voted quote then gets displayed with the number of votes it received. [Quotes taken from here. ](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~damithch/pages/SE-quotes.htm)
