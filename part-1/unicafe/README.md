# UniCafe Restaurant App

This app is built with React + Vite. It allows a user to give feedback about their experience at the UniCafe restaurant (good, neutral, bad). Statistics are then calculated and displayed regarding the overall feedback of the restaurant (e.g., number of good clicks, number of neutral clicks, positive feedback percentage, average restaurant rating, etc.).
