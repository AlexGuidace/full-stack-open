# Country Data App

This app is built with React, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) library, and integrates two external APIs: a [weather API](https://openweathermap.org), and a [world's countries API](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/). With this RESTful application, a user can look up countries to get information regarding those countries displayed to the UI (e.g., languages spoken in a country, a country's flag, the current weather of a country's capital, etc.). A user can also control which countries are displayed if multiple results are returned from their search.
