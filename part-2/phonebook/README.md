# Phonebook App

This app is built with React, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) library, and the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) library. The app contains a RESTful API using CRUD operations on a database of people, served by json-server. An entry to the phonebook can be created, updated, and deleted by a user. A user can also search the phonebook for people.
