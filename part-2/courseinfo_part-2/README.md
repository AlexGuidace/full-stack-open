# Course Information App (Part 2)

This app is built with React + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It expands on the original [Course Information app](https://github.com/AlexGuidace/full-stack-open/tree/main/part-1/courseinfo) through refactoring of React components into separate modules, using additional data, and implementing additional JS.
